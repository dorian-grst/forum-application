**SAE COLLECTIVE DECISION-MAKING APPLICATION** üè∑Ô∏è

In this repository, you will find our work on the Collective Decision-Making Application SAE [2nd year], in which we had to create an application that allows different users to ask a question and receive answers, all accompanied by a voting system and different roles.

# Installation

1. Download or clone the application repository to your local computer.
2. Make sure you have an up-to-date version of PHP installed on your computer. If not, you can download the latest version from the official PHP website (https://windows.php.net/download/).
3. Open a terminal and navigate to the application directory.
4. Run the command `composer install` to install all the required dependencies for the application.

# Launch

1. Make sure you are in the application directory in the terminal.
2. Run the command `php -S localhost:8000` to launch the local PHP server.
3. Open your web browser and go to the address `http://localhost:8000` to access the application.
